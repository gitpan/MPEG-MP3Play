Revision history for Perl extension MPEG::MP3Play.

0.03  Thu Aug 05 1999, joern
	- gen_constant generates constants.h included by
	  MP3Play.xs. gen_constant checks defines and enums,
	  not only defines like h2xs does.
	- so now all Xaudio symbols are available
	- gen* scripts moved to the tools directory
	- test.pl now only loads the module
	- there are now more sophisticated test scripts in
	  the samples directory, e.g. a script which uses
	  Gtk+ to play a file showing a progress bar. This
	  demonstrates the connection of the Xaudio
	  message queue to Gdk.
	  
0.02  Tue Aug 03 1999, joern
	- added gen_conv_msg.pl to generate conv_msg.c out
	  of the HTML documention provided by Xaudio
	- conv_msg.c converts XA messages to HVs, for simple
	  handling in Perl
	- test.pl enhanced. Now shows timecode and exits on
	  key pressure (if Term::ReadKey is installed) and
	  on end of file.
	- fixed minor POD formatting errors in MP3Play.pm

0.01  Sun Jul 25 1999, joern
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
	- my first contact with XS, but playing mp3 files works
	  after two hours. I like it! ;)
	- no error handling at all
