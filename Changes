Revision history for Perl extension MPEG::MP3Play.

0.11  Thu Sep 28 2000, joern
	- actual Xaudio releases lacks the control_message_s?print
	  functions, so loading the .so module fails. Thanks to
          Valery Sherman <sher@moscow.sgi.com> and Gryn <gryn@spinlock.org>
	  for the bug reports. Because these functions were not
	  documented in the MPEG::MP3Play documentation, I disabled
	  the corresponding code for a quick workaround, while reporting
	  this as a bug to Xaudio. Stay tuned, maybe a new bugfix release
	  is coming soon.

	- Equalizer support added, the samples/handler script
	  demonstrates the usage of the equalizer features.
	  The new methods are:
	    $mp3->equalizer ( [$left_lref, $right_lref] )
	    $mp3->get_equalizer 
	- Some news: Bryan Collins <bryan@casper.spirit.net.au> develops
	  a car audio MP3 player system, based on MPEG::MP3Play.
	  See his website for details: http://bry.spirit.net.au/mcoupe/

	- The error messages thrown on exit of the Gtk+ sample
	  scripts are gone. Thanks to Dermot Musgrove for his
	  suggestions. I added a small chapter about preventing
	  these error messages in the documentation.
	- 'runsample' now uses 'perl -w'. MPEG::MP3Play and
	  all sample scripts should now work without throwing
	  warning messages (except 'gtkhandler.pl' where this
	  is intended).
	- There is a new sample script 'gtkinherit.pl' to demonstrate
	  implementing message handlers by subclassing MPEG::MP3Play
	- README.FreeBSD added, thanks go to Bryan Collins
	  <bryan@casper.spirit.net.au> for his detailed information.
	- 'runsample' is now generated by Makefile.PL to ensure that
	  the correct Perl interpreter is used

0.08  Tue Sep 21 1999, joern
	- Bugfix: MP3Play.xs did not compile with Perl 5.004_04, thanks
	  to Dermot Musgrove <dermot@glade.perl.connectfree.co.uk>
	  for his bug report. Now MPEG::MP3Play should work with all
	  Perl versions better or equal than 5.004_04.
	  Testers are welcome.
	- added a section about REPORTING BUGS in the documentation
	  to make my life easier ;)

0.07  Wed Sep 08 1999, joern
	- Bugfix: $mp3->get_message was broken in Version 0.06,
	  among other things the gtk* samples suffered from this
	  bug and did not function
	- the creation of the message hash in MP3Play.xs and
	  conv_msg.c is now much more elegant. Thanks to
	  Dan Sugalski <dan@tuatha.sidhe.org> for the hint.

0.06  Mon Sep 06 1999, joern
	- fixed a memory leak in the get_message* methods.
	  Thanks to Gene Senyszyn <scatt@goes.com> for the
	  detailed bug report

0.05  Mon Aug 09 1999, joern
	- debugging implemented by providing default handlers
	  for XA_MSG_NOTIFY_ACK and _NACK.
	- samples/handler.pl uses debugging for demonstration
	  purposes

0.04  Sat Aug 07 1999, joern
	- implemented a builtin message handler mechanism.
	  Message corresponding methods will be invoked,
	  so the user can simply supply/overload the message
	  methods.
	- added samples/handler.pl and samples/gtkhandler.pl
	  to demonstrate the use of the builtin message handler.
	- added samples/synopsis.pl. This proves that the
	  usage shown in the SYNOPSIS really works ;)
	- no symbols are exported by default anymore, some
	  Exporter tags are available instead.

	  THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.

	  Try 'use MPEG::MP3Play qw(:DEFAULT)' as a first step,
	  but better look into the documentation and see, which
	  symbols you really need to import.
	  
	  I think 'use MPEG::MP3Play qw(:msg :state)' will work
	  in most cases.
	- notification_mask setting
	- player mode setting
	- default message handler for player_state messages
	- fixed some minor documentation typos

0.03  Thu Aug 05 1999, joern
	- gen_constant generates constants.h included by
	  MP3Play.xs. gen_constant checks defines and enums,
	  not only defines like h2xs does.
	- so now all Xaudio symbols are available
	- gen* scripts moved to the tools directory
	- test.pl now only loads the module
	- there are now more sophisticated test scripts in
	  the samples directory, e.g. a script which uses
	  Gtk+ to play a file showing a progress bar. This
	  demonstrates the connection of the Xaudio
	  message queue to Gdk.
	- almost anything well documented now

0.02  Tue Aug 03 1999, joern
	- added gen_conv_msg.pl to generate conv_msg.c out
	  of the HTML documention provided by Xaudio
	- conv_msg.c converts XA messages to HVs, for simple
	  handling in Perl
	- test.pl enhanced. Now shows timecode and exits on
	  key pressure (if Term::ReadKey is installed) and
	  on end of file.
	- fixed minor POD formatting errors in MP3Play.pm

0.01  Sun Jul 25 1999, joern
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
	- my first contact with XS, but playing mp3 files works
	  after two hours. I like it! ;)
	- no error/message handling at all
