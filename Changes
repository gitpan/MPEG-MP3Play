Revision history for Perl extension MPEG::MP3Play.

0.02  Tue Aug 03 14:36:58 1999
	- added gen_conv_msg.pl to generate conv_msg.c out
	  of the HTML documention provided by X-Audio
	- conv_msg.c converts XA messages to HVs, for simple
	  handling in Perl
	- test.pl enhanced. Now shows timecode and exits on
	  key pressure (if Term::ReadKey is installed) and
	  on end of file.
	- fixed minor POD formatting error in MP3Play.pm

0.01  Sun Jul 25 20:56:18 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
	- my first contact with XS, but playing mp3 files works
	  after two hours. I like it! ;)
	- no error handling at all
